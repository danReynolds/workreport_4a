Comparison of React Native to Native Mobile Applications (Swift & Java)

Criteria to compare:

# Pros
* Developer Training and Maintenance (learn one language and done)
* Code sharing between web and native
* Interface design (hot and live reloading vs recompiling), styling easier if coming from web background
* Familiar business logic patterns for navigation, actions/dispatch with Redux vs overhead of understanding our web, android and iOS logic for the equivalent things, discuss what those are
* Deployment benefits with bugfixing via code push

# Cons
* Interface Limitations, transitions are hard to do
* Limited platform specific features and appearance, would require more work to write in two styles iOS 10 and Material design so make it uni-style, might be weird looking
* Mobile developer disinterest, the best mobile developers will want to write native? and therefore won't want to join us if we're React Native

# Structure

# Introduction

Why we are doing this, why it matters to consider this. The benefits we want:

- Low barrier to development
- Ability to write applications effectively and quickly
- Use of tools and services from across teams

# Analysis

- Comparison of the barrier to development
- Comparison of the ability to speed up and optimize development process with cross-platform code sharing
- Comparison of structure of applications, uniformity via common navigation frameworks, redux, etc
- Comparison of new mobile developers, need to hire both Android and iOS vs maybe we wont get the best otherwise.
- Future proofing, need to pick something that will last, react-native has limitations, is it going to be around/a good choice

# Conclusion

- React Native
